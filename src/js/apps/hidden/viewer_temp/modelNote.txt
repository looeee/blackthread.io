Problems with model that had to be corrected:
- rotated at 90 degrees on x axis
- huge scale ( 20 metres tall ) - best to make model fit inside 1 metre box or less
- modelled with quads ( these have to be subdivided at runtime which is bad for mobile devices, best to do this in modelling program )
- very high polygon count ( 200,000 ) polygons. Not suitable for display on mobile devices
