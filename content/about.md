    Hello, and welcome to my website! My name's Lewy, I'm a Irish front end JavaScript expert and recovering circus performer,
    specializing in WebGL with three.js.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently living the digital nomad dream in various beautiful places
    around South East Asia, climbing volcanoes, diving, eating spicy food
    and even doing a little programming from time to time.
  </p>
  <p>
    Have a look around the site for examples of my recent
    <a href="/blog/">blog</a> posts,
    <a href="/experiments/">experiments</a>,
    and my series of
    <a href="/tutorials/">tutorials</a>
    on getting up and running with three.js.

    I'm a collaborator on the <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js">three.js opensource project</a> which recently, probably
    the top library for displaying 3D in the browser, which recently gained some extra claim to fame since Facebook now use it for
    displaying 3D posts in the news feed.
