Welcome to section 1, where we can finally get those creative juices flowing! This section is a gentle introduction to creating scenes with three.js.

We'll explain how everything works as we go, but the explanations will be as short and simple as possible - we'll add detail in later chapters.

Starting in chapter 1.0, we'll take a look at the basic components of a three.js and the bare minimum we need to get three.js to display something on screen. It turns out (excluding comments), that this is only 15 lines of code. Not too bad!

In the following chapters, we'll add animation, camera controls and lights and learn how to deal with the browser window resizing.

We'll round out the section with a look at how to move things around in the scene using translation, rotation and scaling (_linear transformations_).
