Congratulations! You've made it through these introductory tutorials and you now have a basic understanding of what makes up a 3D scene - and not only that, but you now have a basic idea of how a 3D scene works in nearly any graphics engine! Take this knowledge and apply it to Unity, Unreal, Blender, Maya, 3DS Max, and literally hundred of other 3D engines and creation tools and the same concepts apply.

Of course, your journey has just begun. Now you need to strike out on your own and put these ideas into practice. Do it soon, or they'll quickly fade.

Fortunately, there are lots of places where you can get help as you go along. I'll quickly go over a few here.

#### [The official three.js forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/)

The best place to find help with three.js is the official [forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/). It's only been around since April 2017, but it's very active and there are lots of helpful people who will be happy to help you out.

You might even find me there! I'm an admin and my username is [@looeee](https://discourse.threejs.org/u/looeee/activity). Say hi!

Remember to read the guidelines before posting, and always include as much detail as you can - preferably including a live Codepen example. You can use your fancy new app as a starting point. Cool, right?

#### [Three.js on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js?sort=votes)

Traditionally, Stack Overflow has been the place to ask three.js related questions.

It is still a good place to check first before you make a post elsewhere. If you click the <span class="fa fa-fw fa-search" aria-hidden="true"></span> icon on the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js?sort=votes) page, it will allow you to search through all the answers related to three.js.

Be warned: three.js has a very rapid development cycle. Answers here are still useful, but they are likely to have outdated information.

Fortunately a fairly complete list of all the changes is maintained on the [Migration Guide](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Migration-Guide) in the wiki, so if you're trying to follow an old answer, or an old tutorial, be sure to keep an eye on that too.

#### [The three.js subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs)

It's not particularly active, but you can also try your luck with the [three.js subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs). You are likely to find interesting projects showcased there from time to time though, so it's worth checking. Just beware of falling into the black hole of reddit and having your life sucked away into a dreary existence of memes and trolling.

#### Thank you!

Thanks for sticking with me this far! I hope these tutorials have been helpful.
If they have, get in touch or leave a comment below. I'd love to hear from you.
