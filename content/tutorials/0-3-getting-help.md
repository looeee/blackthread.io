### So you need help?

What's that? You are completely frustrated, about to tear your hair out with frustration? You are cursing this abomination of a library, casting it out, never to darken your hard drive again?

Well, I have some good news for you!

First, take a deep breath, go outside and pet some kittens or shout at them or whatever else relieves your tortured soul (seriously, don't shout at kittens). Then say this to yourself three times:

WebGL is HARD

Yes, it's true. Not only are you taking on all the difficulties of 3D graphics programming, you are also taking on all the quirks of web development. When it goes wrong, it goes very wrong, and there are many many quirks to get to grips with.

### Then fear not, for help is at hand!

Once you have calmed down, petted those kittens and taken stock of your situation a little, it's time to go searching for help.

I have good news for you.  There are many places for you to find the help you need, filled with kind, happy, generous and above all _knowledgeable_ people.

First though, a word of advice: make it easy for people to help you.

I've spent quite a bit of time on forums myself, both helping people and receiving help, and I present to you the _Golden Rule of Getting Help on Forums_:

{:.notice}
People will match your effort

Explain the things you have tried so far. Show your code, or even better, make a live example that demonstrates the issue. Use this [basic example](https://codepen.io/looeee/pen/aEBKYK) on Codepen as a starting point. Paste in any error messages from the browser console (remember the magic shortcut `CTRL + SHIFT + I`).

On the other hand, if you write a one-sentence question that looks something like "I can't get textures to load help guys plz!", then you will not get much help.

#### [Three.js on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js?sort=votes)

Traditionally, Stack Overflow has been the place to ask three.js related questions.

It is still the best first place to check first. If you click the <span class="fa fa-fw fa-search" aria-hidden="true"></span> icon on the [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/three.js?sort=votes) page, it will allow you to search through all the answers related to three.js.

Be warned: three.js has a very rapid development cycle. Older answers are likely to have outdated information.

#### [The official three.js forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/)

If you can't find a solution on StackOverflow, the next best place is the official [forum](https://discourse.threejs.org/). It's only been around since April 2017, so there are fewer answers, but they are more likely to be up to date. Also, StackOverflow has very formal requirements and a somewhat ...notorious moderator community. As a beginner you'll probably get a friendlier response on the forum.

You might even find me there! My username is [@looeee](https://discourse.threejs.org/u/looeee/activity). Say hi!

#### [The three.js subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs)

It's not particularly active, but you can also try your luck with the [three.js subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/threejs). You are likely to find interesting projects showcased there from time to time though, so it's worth checking. Just beware of falling into the black hole of reddit and having your life sucked away into a dreary existence of means and trolling.

#### Don't ask for help on Github

Seriously - it's for developing the library, not helping people with their code. All the people there are busy and working for free. Don't waste their time with basic questions.

Most of the active developers hang out on the forum anyway, and they'll be a lot more responsive if you ask your question there.

On the other hand, if you think you have found a bug, a mistake in the docs, or you have a suggestion for something new that you would like added to the library, then you can raise an issue on [github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues).
