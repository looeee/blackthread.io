Welcome to the Black Thread series of tutorials on [three.js](https://threejs.org/)! Here we'll focus on getting to know three.js in depth - all the amazing features that make this beautiful library so great to work with, but also all how to deal with all the quirks and annoyances that you will undoubtedly come across, so that you can quickly become familiar enough to start building your own projects.

These tutorials are intended to be supplementary to the [official documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/) and you'll be referred there regularly (*author disclaimer:* I wrote quite a bit of that documentation, so if you find a mistake there it is probably my fault. Please let me know here or raise an issue on [github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/) and I'll fix it ASAP!). Also, the best resources for understanding what three.js is capable of, once you are a little familiar with the library, are the [official examples](https://threejs.org/examples/). Go through them and get to know the source code in depth, you won't regret it.

You are expected to have a basic grasp of JavaScript and know how to get your code running in a web browser, although we will be covering everything that you need to know to get going.

If you need some inspiration to get you started, have a look at the [threejs.org](https://threejs.org/) frontpage which features a regularly updated collection of some cutting edge work from around the web.

These tutorials are work in progress - see the menu on the left for currently available tutorials. I'll be adding more as soon as possible! And if you want a specific tutorial please [let me know]({{ site.url }}/contact/).

### Section 0 (Introduction)
We'll start with a quick overview of WebGL and what you need to get it running on a computer, tablet or phone. Then we'll take a quick overview of the [three.js repo](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) on github, which is where all the magic happens, and we'll finish up the introduction with some tips on getting help and reporting bugs and how to set up a development server.

### Section 1 (First Steps)
We'll get going properly here, making sure we understand the basics - the components that make up every 3D scene, how to create objects, lights, cameras and how to apply simple materials and textures to our creations, as well as how to work with the [Scene](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/scenes/Scene), how to [Group](https://threejs.org/docs/#api/objects/Group) objects and how to set up our canvas to resize automatically if the browser window size changes.

This section will use the most basic programming techniques possible while we get up to speed, so for now we'll stick to old style (plain, or ES5) Javascript that you can just write in a text editor and open in any browser. We'll also include an equivalent ES6 Codepen live version at the bottom of each tutorial, so you can compare the differences. We'll use this section to learn (or revise) all the basics, and make sure we are up to speed with the terminology we'll need to go deeper.

### Code examples
You can find any of the codepens used in the tutorials [here](https://codepen.io/collection/DKNVdO/), and all the gists [here](https://gist.github.com/looeee/).


Happy coding!
