Welcome to the Black Thread series of tutorials on [three.js](https://threejs.org/)! These tutorials are intended to get you up to speed and creating your own three.js apps, fast. We'll cover the basics of understanding the library while incrementally creating a basic scene, starting with the absolute bare minimum required to get something to display (render) and then working up from there to add camera controls, animation, automatic resizing, textures, lights and more.

Once you have followed through to the end of Chapter 6, you will have a solid understanding of the components of a three.js scene and will be able to proceed with building your own apps that will run in any modern browser, on phones, tablets and laptops.

You will also have created a basic app that follows best practices and is ready to be expanded to hold your own beautiful creations.

The tutorials will be regularly updated to make sure that they work with the latest version of three.js. Currently that is r90, but a new version is released about once a month.

However the basic API used in these tutorials is unlikely to change anytime soon, so just make sure you are always using the latest release when you start a new project and you shouldn't have any problems.

### Prerequisites

You are expected to have a basic grasp of JavaScript and know how to get your code running in a web browser, although we will be covering everything that you need to know as we go along.

### Code examples

All the tutorials have live examples to accompany them, using Codepen. You can find any of the codepens used in the tutorials [here](https://codepen.io/collection/DKNVdO/).

### Official documentation, examples and showcase

These tutorials are intended to be supplementary to the [official documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/) and you'll be referred there regularly (*author disclaimer:* I wrote quite a bit of that documentation, so if you find a mistake there it is probably my fault. Please let me know here or raise an issue on [github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/) and I'll fix it ASAP!).

Aside from the documentation (and these tutorials {{< emoji ":wink:" >}}), the best resources for understanding three.js are the [official examples](https://threejs.org/examples/). Go through them and get to know the source code in depth, you won't regret it.

If you need some inspiration to get yourself started, or need to take a break from coding, have a look through the [threejs.org](https://threejs.org/) frontpage which features a regularly updated collection of some cutting edge work from around the web. There are some really amazing projects listed there.

### Up next

Starting in chapter 1, we'll take a look at the basic components of a three.js and the bare minimum we need to get three.js to display something on screen. It turns out (excluding comments), that this is only 15 lines of JavaScript. Not too bad!

In the following chapters, we'll add animation, camera controls and lights and learn how to deal with the browser window resizing. In no time at all we'll have a fully fledged app ready to be used in your own projects.

We'll round out the section with a look at how to move things around in the scene using translation, rotation and scaling, also known as linear transformations.

Happy coding!
