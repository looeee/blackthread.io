Welcome to the Black Thread series of tutorials on [three.js](https://threejs.org/)! These tutorials are intended to get you up to speed and creating your own three.js apps, fast. We'll cover the basics of understanding the library and then incrementally create a basic scene, starting with the absolute bare minimum required to get something to display (render) and then working up from there to add camera controls, animation, automatic resizing, textures, lights and so on.

Once you have followed through to the end, you will have a solid understanding of the basics and will be able to proceed with building your own apps that will run in any modern browser, on phones, tablets and laptops.

The tutorials will be regularly updated to make sure that they work with the latest version of three.js - currently that is R90. A new version is released about once a month, however while we are dealing with the basics the API is unlikely to change anytime soon, so just make sure you are always using the latest release when you start a new project.

These tutorials are intended to be supplementary to the [official documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/) and you'll be referred there regularly (*author disclaimer:* I wrote quite a bit of that documentation, so if you find a mistake there it is probably my fault. Please let me know here or raise an issue on [github](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/) and I'll fix it ASAP!). Also, the best resources for understanding what three.js is capable of, once you are a little familiar with the library, are the [official examples](https://threejs.org/examples/). Go through them and get to know the source code in depth, you won't regret it.

If you need some inspiration to get yourself started, have a look at the [threejs.org](https://threejs.org/) frontpage which features a regularly updated collection of some cutting edge work from around the web.

### Prerequisites

You are expected to have a basic grasp of JavaScript and know how to get your code running in a web browser, although we will be covering everything that you need to know as we go along.

### Code examples

All the tutorials have live examples to accompany them, using Codepen. You can find any of the codepens used in the tutorials [here](https://codepen.io/collection/DKNVdO/).

### Up next

We'll start with a quick overview of WebGL and what you need to get it running on a computer, tablet or phone. Then we'll take a quick overview of the [three.js repo](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) on github, which is where all the magic happens, and we'll finish up the introduction with some tips on getting help and reporting bugs and how to set up a development server.

Happy coding!
