      <description>Congratulations! You made it to Section 2! That means you know have a basic understanding of how to set up a three.js scene, how to make it animate, add textures, camera controls and even automatically resize along with the browser window.
In this section we&amp;rsquo;ll be taking a closer look at some of the components that make up three.js, as well as some of the helper objects.
We&amp;rsquo;ll take a look at how the various components fit together (inheritance) and take our first in depth animation of an object - the Object3D which is the base class for nearly everything in three.</description>

      <description>Strap in folks, it&amp;rsquo;s time to push some pixels!
Let&amp;rsquo;s get our first three.js scene up and running. When we are finished with chapters 1 and 2, we&amp;rsquo;ll have this glorious beast shining and rotating before us:

Follow along on Codepen I mentioned a few times in the introductory chapters that we&amp;rsquo;ll be using Codepen throughout these tutorials, and that you can either follow along there or create local files on your computer, but since I assume that lots of people are like me and skip introductory chapters, I should probably mention it again.</description>

      <title>Requirements for running a three.js scene</title>
      <link>https://www.blackthreaddesign.com/tutorials/0-0-requirements/</link>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll start with a quick overview of what you need to get a basic three.js app working. Please take the time to read over the topics in the introduction (we&amp;rsquo;ll get to the pretty 3D stuff soon, I promise!).
WebGL In these tutorials, we are going to be focusing on the WebGLRenderer. As the name implies, this requires a WebGL enabled device. Not so long ago, this was something that we had to worry about.</description>

      <title>Shapes and Transformations</title>

      <description>In this chapter, we&amp;rsquo;ll take a lighting quick look at some of the geometric shapes that are built into three.js. We&amp;rsquo;ve already seen two of them, the Torus Knot from chapters 1.1 and 1.2, and the Box from Chapter 1.3.
We&amp;rsquo;ll also take a look at how to move them around (translate them), scale them up and down and rotate them. Collectively, along with the less common shear, these are known as transformations (technically, they are linear or affine transformations).</description>
