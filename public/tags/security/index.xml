      <description>So far we have just created a simple coloured material for our mesh. If we want to create something more realistic we&amp;rsquo;ll have to move onto using texture mapping.
Put very simply, this means taking an image and stretching it over the surface of a 3D object. Of course, this will be very easy to do if the surface of the 3D object is square, and less easy of the surface is curved and knotted.</description>
