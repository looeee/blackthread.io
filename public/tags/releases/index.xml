      <description>Semver? No way! The development pace of three.js is fast, and it uses a slightly unusual versioning system. Most software gets released incrementally as V0.5, V0.6, V1.0, V1.1.1 etc. This is known as semver, or Semantic Versioning.
Well, three.js is far too hipster for that - instead, we use a revision system. There&amp;rsquo;s a new revision out about once month or so, and we are currently up to Revision 88 (R88), as of mid December 2017.</description>
