      <description>Promises are great! Promises are the future! Well, async/await is probably the future, but lets take things one step at a time here.
In case you don&amp;rsquo;t know, promises simplify the process of dealing with asynchronous operations.
An asynchronous operation is something that might take a while - you don&amp;rsquo;t want to halt the program while you are waiting, so you need some way of waiting until your time taking task has run, and then resuming operation at that point in the program.</description>
