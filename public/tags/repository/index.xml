      <description>Everything officially related to the three.js project is in one rather monolithic repository on Github. Its maintained by the original creator of three.js, @mrdoob (AKA Ricardo Cabello), along with an army of open-source aficionados.
It&amp;rsquo;s a huge and very active repo - the 16th most starred Javascript library on Github in fact, and the 8th most forked. Its up there with superstars like React, jQuery and Node.js.
It&amp;rsquo;s also quite overwhelming at first glance, but luckily we only need to look inside two folders for now.</description>
